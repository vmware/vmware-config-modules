#### get(context)

Get authorized members in the SystemConfiguration.BashShellAdministrators group.

We limit our traversal to the first level of groups because a group can have subgroups, which in turn can
contain groups with users. This approach is consistent with the behavior of the dir-cli command:
<br/>
```shell
/usr/lib/vmware-vmafd/bin/dir-cli group list --name <group_name>
```

Sample get output
<br/>
```json
[
  {
    "name": "user-1",
    "domain": "vmware.com",
    "member_type": "USER"
  },
  {
    "name": "user-2",
    "domain": "vmware.com",
    "member_type": "USER"
  },
  {
    "name": "devops",
    "domain": "vsphere.local",
    "member_type": "GROUP"
  }
]
```

#### set(context, desired_values)

Remediation has not been implemented for this control. It’s possible that a customer may legitimately add
: a new user and forget to update the control accordingly. Remediating the control could lead to the removal
  of these users, with potential unknown implications.

* **Parameters:**
  * **context** (*VcenterContext*) – Product context instance.
  * **desired_values** (*List*) – List of objects containing users and groups details with name, domain and member_type.
* **Returns:**
  Tuple of “status” and list of error messages.

  Tuple
